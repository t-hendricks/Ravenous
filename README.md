# Ravenous
![Ravenous Demo](RavDemo.gif)
This program is a front end application using Yelp's API. Search and find anything food related in a location with a few filters. The program should return a list of items with an address, review count, and ratings for each item in the list. All of my work are in the "./src/components" & "./src/util" directories.
